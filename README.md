# Metro__ Route Planner  

Welcome to the **Metro__ Route Planner** repository! This project focuses on developing and optimizing route planning algorithms using C++ and Dijkstra's algorithm, specifically designed for the Delhi Metro Rail network.  

## Key Features  
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Efficient computation of the shortest paths between metro stations, ensuring real-time route planning and optimization.  
- **Graph Representation**: The metro network is structured as a graph data model in C++, enabling fast traversal and pathfinding.  
- **User Interface**: A command-line interface (CLI) allows users to input their starting and destination stations to receive optimal routes and estimated travel times.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhancements to improve algorithm efficiency, considering the scale of the metro network and variable traffic conditions.  
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Utilization of priority queues and adjacency lists for efficient graph traversal and memory management.
